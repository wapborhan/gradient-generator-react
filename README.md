A gradient generator seems fun. I do mostly use mycolors.space website to generate gradient in different formats. In the weekend I decided to make my own gradient generator and I have made a similar clone of mycolors.space. Take a look at the demo here.

The Gradient generator has options for changing the direction and the colors.  It takes to parameters of colors and generates 3 most related colors between them.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
